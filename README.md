Please download the dataset at here:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe/data

Before running the program, please change the data files path in the code. Or, you can download the dataset and unzip it following the path in the code (regression part code is in “F:/ingv/”, CNN part code is in current path of running code)

To check result, you can run the code of Regression part and CNN part separately.  We recommend you run the Jupyter edition on Jupyterlab (Regression_Jupyter and CNN_jupyter). Jupyter edition have the previous result of our running, which you can use to check the result. (there are some random numbers in the code, so different running can have different results). If you cannot open .ipynb file, you can run pure code edition.

Before running, please install all packages needed, like pandas, sklearn, xgboost, Keras.
